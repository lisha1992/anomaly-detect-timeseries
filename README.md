# Using an LSTM for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

Using an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) algorithm on synthetic time series data for unsupervised anomaly detection.  It uses the Mean Squared Error as a measure of such outliers in this data. 

- [x] Keras (TF backend)
- [ ] Vary sequence length (RNNs accept input sequences of varying lengths due to weight sharing in the hidden layers!)
- [ ] Estimates on real-world data (e.g. [this Kaggle rain dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-much-did-it-rain-ii/data))
- [ ] PyTorch
